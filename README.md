# Open_GL-Studies
A compilation of my studies as I mess around with OpenGL and learn the API.
Most of this code will reflect the code in the tutorials at https://learnopengl.com and therefore I am not claiming to be my own original code.
I am simply posting my progress with my studies in OpenGL, and as I learn more about the API I will begin making changes of my own.
